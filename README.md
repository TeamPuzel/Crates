### A Rust crate browser for GNOME.

It is very minimal in design and implementation and written in Zig.

To build use:
```
zig build -Ddev-install
```
Building depends on the libadwaita-1 development package and the Zig compiler.
It may not build with the latest compiler as it is very unstable but it should always be up to date with my fork of Zig.
